# parser
The objective of the parser is to give proper trigonometric output to the input string.

The Trigonometric expressions are then used to solve the achived output. The entire code base is written in JavaScript this will help with the linear problem resolution and easier to understand approach. Using python to solve this would not be a efficient way to use the code, as it consumes more time to achive the result.

In the later stages of the Project we will be a implementing code to solve the achived Trigonometric function.made
